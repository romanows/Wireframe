# Overview
Draws a rotating wireframe box.

One of my first Java programs, worked out in my spare time while in   
the Peace Corps, circa 2004.  I developed the math (it's all simple    
trigonomotry, no matrices) on paper because we had no continuous   
electricity.  My laptop was charged on the school generator at night,   
and I would write code by lantern light in the early, early morning.   

As an Electrical Engineer, I never took a Computer Science graphics   
class where this sort of thing is commonly written.  It was the   
fulfillment of an early childhood goal: to understand the math behind   
some form of 3d rendering and to implement a spinning box.  It turns   
out to be way easier than I realized at the time!    

There's little documentation, obscurely named variables, and a few   
bugs.  I touched up the source code a smidge, mostly fixing file    
structure, but its mostly original.  This is just a nostalgia backup  
for the author, please don't bother with it!
